NAME OF THE SYSTEM:  **Order System**

# PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM:

The order system is a collection made up of five subsystems whose primary aim is to facilitate the ordering process between the establishment and the customer which is represented by two entities: The Customer Service Rep Entity and The Cusomer Entity. Three of these subsystems are software subsystems that give different abilities to both entities in order for a purchase to go smoothly and be successful. On the other hand, the two remaining subsystems don't include software but are still key to the order system.

The first of these software systems is the inventory system which tracks the inventory supply of products. It allows both entities to check whether a certain product is available or not. The second software subsystem is the credit system which allows users to check the credit that is available to the customer entity while purchasing. The last software system is the order history system which gives a detailed account of the status of the ordered item and enables both entities to check on the status.

The order system requires both entities to use the software systems available to facilitate the whole order process. There are also a few actions outside the software subsystems that is needed from both entities such as the need to maintain the customer. All of the systems and actions are available to both entities with the exception of one. The customer service rep needs to authorize return whenever it is requested by the cutomer entity.

1. Inventory System
2. Credit System
3. Order History System
